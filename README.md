# UProjects
College projects :c

Project1: This first project is 3 things in 1, the first consists of a sorter of numbers from 1 to 100 that creates a list of the primes in this range; The second consists of a sorter of even, odd and prime numbers where the user first places the amount of numbers he wants to sort and then the numbers to be sorted; The third simply adds up the amount of numbers the user wants.
(These three place the digits in the excel cells).
